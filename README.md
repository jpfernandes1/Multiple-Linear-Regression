# Multiple-Linear-Regression
Calculates the approximate consumption of a vehicle based on three data classes.


### Simple linear Regression

Variables:

X = disp (engine capacity)
Y = mpg (miles per gallon)

Results:

R = -0,847
R² = 0.718

Multiple Linear Regression

Variables:

X = cyl (number of cylinders), disp (engine capacity), hp (horse power)
Y = mpg (miles per gallon)

Results:

r = 0,876
R² = 0,768

Insights:

The correlation between indepent and dependent variables is negative.

We can say that using more variables, the model becomes more reliable.
